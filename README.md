# Citibike-Data-Exploration

## Some exploratory data analysis, including a Choropleth map which investigates which NYC neighbourhoods have the most in-use Citibike docks for the city of New York (for Neighborhood Tabulation Areas I use a shapefile from NYC Open Data).
## Data is for the month of October, 2019 only.
